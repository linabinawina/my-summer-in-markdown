## Introduction
<p> My name is Lina Santana and I am currently in 10th grade. I am in cross country and wrestling. I am Mexican and Salvadoran. This is my second year taking a AP Computer Science class, and I'm a little nervous. I know it is going to be fun though, but I'm not sure about the test! I have 3 dogs and 1 cat, along with a lot of fish. I have 2 older siblings, one being 12 years older, and the other being 4 years older. I'm excited to be in this class!!! </p>

## Summer Activities
<p> Over the summer, I had my 15th birthday. I celebrated it by having a quincenera. It was super fun and probably the highlight of my summer!!! We danced a lot and a lot of my friends and family came. I got lots of presents and photos with everybody and it made me feel so happpy how everyone was enjoying their time at my party. The party didn't end until 12, and afterwards I was so tired. Besides that, it was awesome! </p> 

## Favorite Book or Movie
<p> My favorite movie is Waves. This movie is about a highschooler who does wrestling who experiences a life changing injury. He decided to keep going through with wrestling, since it was his last year at highschool. However, he got injured even worse and his life just went downhill from there. It's my favorite because the emotions in the movie and how everything is so deep really made me so into this movie. It changed my perspective on life and really impacted me so much. I don't want to spoil anything, but it kept getting crazier and crazier!!! </p>

## Summer Playlist
<p> Over the summer, I really got into Joji, Radiohead, Malcolm Todd, Daniel Ceaser, and Tyler, the Creator. I like every song by Malcolm Todd. I feel like all of his music is just unique in a way and really sounds good. I listened to "Slow Dancing in the Dark" by Joji almost every day during the summer. That song scratches my brain in such a good way and it honestly is probably my favorite song ever! For Radiohead, I listened to a variety, but mostly his most popular songs. I normally listen to Radiohead when I'm down, because I feel like all of their songs are just sad. I listen to every Tyler, the Creator song! Each song is different, but it all sounds so good! For Daniel Ceaser, I love the song "Loose" and "Toronto 2014" because they're both so soft sompared to the rest of the artists. </p>

## Sports or Physical Activities
<p> Over the summer, I ran to prepare myself for cross country season. I am prone to heat exhaustion, so I tried my best to get used to the heat before actual practice started. Also, I participated in the cross country summer program near the end of the summer. We would go to different parks and run up hills in the HOT WEATHER. Although it was excruciating, I enjoyed it because I feel like it helped improve my performance for practice now! Besides that, I would practice for my quincenera, which lowkey made me tired!  </p>
